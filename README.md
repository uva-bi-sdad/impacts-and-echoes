# Impacts and Echoes: The Lasting Impact of the White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health

This repo gives a broad overview of the scientific, political and social events related to nutition, food and health over the course of the 20th century. In these files, we created interactive timelines to map relevant events before and after the 1969 White House Conference on Nutrition, Food and Health. We also conducted some basic word frequency analysis on titles and abstracts of scientific articles from 1919-1989 and 1990-2018 as well as text network of the 1969 WHC Report. Other contributions are likely forthcoming.
